## 🎮 Developer Notes

All Easter eggs are implemented in `/components/EasterEggs.tsx` and integrated throughout the app:

- **Main wrapper:** `<EasterEggs>` component wraps the entire app
- **Konami Code:** Uses sequential key detection with state tracking
- **Secret phrases:** Tracks last 20 characters typed
- **Triple-click detection:** Custom `useTripleClick` hook with 500ms timeout
- **Emoji click counter:** Custom `useEmojiClickCounter` hook
- **Confetti:** Uses `canvas-confetti` library
- **Animations:** Motion (formerly Framer Motion) for smooth transitions

### Adding New Easter Eggs:

1. **Keyboard-based:** Add to `EasterEggs.tsx` `useEffect` keyboard listener
2. **Click-based:** Use the provided hooks (`useTripleClick`, `useEmojiClickCounter`)
3. **Milestone-based:** Add logic to component with `useEffect` tracking state
4. **Visual effects:** Use Motion animations and confetti library
