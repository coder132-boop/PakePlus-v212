## House Collaboration

### Creating a House:
- When you sign up as an admin, you create a new house
- Choose a unique `house_id` (e.g., "smith-house-2025")

### Inviting Housemates:
1. **Share your House ID**:
   - Give your housemates the house_id you created
   - They can find it in the signup form

2. **Housemates join**:
   - They enter your `house_id` when signing up
   - They select "Member" role (unless you want multiple admins)
   - Everyone with the same ID sees the same tasks!

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Database not set up" error:
- Make sure you ran the SQL script completely
- Check for errors in the SQL Editor
- Verify all three tables were created:
  - `user_profiles`
  - `recurring_tasks`
  - `chores`

### "Signup failed" error:
- Ensure Email authentication is enabled in Supabase
- Check password is at least 6 characters
- Verify SQL script ran successfully

### Can't see housemate's tasks:
- Confirm you used the same `house_id` when signing up
- Both users must be logged in
- Refresh the page

### Tasks not auto-generating:
- Make sure an admin created recurring tasks first
- Check the recurrence pattern matches today
- Recurring tasks generate chores for the current date automatically

### Members can't create recurring tasks:
- This is intentional! Only admins can create recurring task templates
- Members can view and complete assigned tasks
