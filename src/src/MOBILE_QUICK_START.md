# üì± Mobile Testing - Quick Start

## ‚ö° Fastest Way to View on Mobile

### Option 1: Local Network Access (2 steps!)

1. **Run this command:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:mobile
   ```

2. **Look for this line in terminal:**
   ```
   ‚ûú  Network: http://192.168.1.100:5173/
   ```

3. **On your phone:**
   - Open browser (Safari, Chrome, etc.)
   - Type that Network URL
   - Make sure phone is on same WiFi as computer!

### Option 2: Deploy to Vercel (Access Anywhere!)

1. **Install Vercel:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

3. **Get URL like:**
   ```
   https://chorecore-abc123.vercel.app
   ```

4. **Open on ANY device** - works anywhere!
