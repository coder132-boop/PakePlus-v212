# ⚡ START YOUR CHORECORE APP NOW

**Quick fix for blank screen - choose your method:**

---

## 🎯 Method 1: Test Locally (Quick)

**Use this to test the desktop app right now:**

### Step 1: Start Preview Server
```bash
npm run preview
```

**Keep this terminal running!** You'll see:
```
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:4173/
```

### Step 2: Open Your ChoreCore App

Double-click the ChoreCore app you created.

**It should work now!** 🎉

**Note:** Keep the preview server running while you use the app.

---

## 🚀 Method 2: Deploy & Package (Production)

**Use this to create a real distributable app:**

### Step 1: Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Install Vercel
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

You'll get a URL like: `https://chorecore-abc123.vercel.app`

### Step 2: Test Your Deployed Site

Open the URL in your browser - make sure it works!

### Step 3: Create Desktop App

```bash
# Delete old app
rm -rf output/

# Create new app with deployed URL
pake https://chorecore-abc123.vercel.app --name ChoreCore
```

### Step 4: Test & Distribute

Open the app from `/output` folder - it works standalone!

**Share with users!** 🎉

## 🤔 Which Method Should I Use?

### Local Testing (Method 1)
✅ Quick testing  
✅ Development  
❌ Can't share with others  
❌ Need server running  

**Use when:** Testing changes quickly

### Production (Method 2)
✅ Real distribution  
✅ Standalone app  
✅ Share with anyone  
✅ No server needed  

**Use when:** Ready to deploy

---

## 🔍 Why Was It Blank?

PakePlus creates a **web wrapper** - it loads your website in a native window.

When you created the app with:
```bash
pake http://localhost:4173
```

It pointed to localhost, but **no server was running** = blank screen.

**Fix:**
- Either: Run the server (Method 1)
- Or: Package deployed URL (Method 2)

---

## ✅ Quick Commands
