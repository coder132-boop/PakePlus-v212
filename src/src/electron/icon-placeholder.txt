# ChoreCore Icon Placeholder

This file is a placeholder for the actual application icons.

## To Build Desktop App

You need to add the following icon files to this folder:

1. **icon.png** (1024x1024) - For Linux builds
2. **icon.ico** (multi-size) - For Windows builds
3. **icon.icns** (multi-size) - For macOS builds

## Quick Solution

If you don't have icons yet, you can:

1. Create a simple 1024x1024 PNG with ChoreCore branding
2. Use online tools to convert:
   - [iConvert Icons](https://iconverticons.com/online/)
   - [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-ico)

## Placeholder Icons

The app will build with placeholder icons, but for professional distribution,
replace these with your actual ChoreCore logo.

## Recommended Design

- House icon with checkmark
- Teal/cyan gradient (#00C2A8 to #00FFD1)
- Simple, recognizable at small sizes
- Works on light and dark backgrounds
