# 😕 I'm Confused - Help Me Start ChoreCore!

## Are You Asking: "Where Do I Type These Commands?"

### The Answer: In Your Computer's Terminal!

---

## 🎯 Super Simple 3-Step Method

### Step 1: Open VS Code

**What is VS Code?** It's a text editor (like Microsoft Word, but for code).

**Don't have it?** Download from: https://code.visualstudio.com/

### Step 2: Open Your ChoreCore Folder

```
In VS Code:
  Click "File" (top left)
    ↓
  Click "Open Folder"
    ↓
  Find your "chorecore" folder
    ↓
  Click "Open"
```

**What is the chorecore folder?** It's the folder with all your ChoreCore files (`App.tsx`, `package.json`, etc.)

### Step 3: Open Terminal in VS Code

**Press this key combination:** `Ctrl` + `` ` ``

(The backtick `` ` `` is the key above Tab, left of the number 1)

**A panel will appear at the bottom of VS Code.** That's your terminal!

---

## ✅ Now You Can Type Commands!

In that terminal at the bottom, type:

```bash
npm install
```

Press Enter. Wait 1-2 minutes.

Then type:

```bash
npm run dev:mobile
```

Press Enter.

**You should see:**
```
➜  Network: http://192.168.1.100:5173/
```

**That's the URL to open on your phone!**

## 🤔 Still Confused?

### "What is a terminal?"

A terminal is a text-based way to give commands to your computer.

Think of it like:
- **Desktop icons** = Click with mouse (visual)
- **Terminal** = Type commands (text)

Both do the same thing, just different ways!

### "I don't see a terminal in VS Code"

**Three ways to open it:**

1. **Keyboard:** Press `Ctrl` + `` ` ``
2. **Menu:** Click `View` → `Terminal`
3. **Top bar:** Click `Terminal` → `New Terminal`

### "What does npm mean?"

**npm** = Node Package Manager

It's a program that comes with Node.js. It helps you:
- Install code libraries
- Run development servers
- Build projects

You don't need to understand it deeply! Just type the commands. 😊

### "Where do I download Node.js?"

Go to: https://nodejs.org/

Click the big green button that says **"Download LTS"**

Install it like any other program.

### "What is localhost?"

`localhost` means "this computer."

When you see `http://localhost:5173/`, it means your computer is running a web server that only you can access (on that computer).

When you see `http://192.168.1.100:5173/`, it means other devices on your WiFi (like your phone) can access it too!

## 🆘 Emergency Help - Nothing Works!

### Step 1: Install Node.js

Go to https://nodejs.org/ and install it.

**How to check if it's installed:**
Open VS Code terminal and type:
```bash
node --version
```

If you see a version number (like `v20.11.0`), it's installed! ✅

### Step 2: Open the Right Folder

Make sure you opened the **chorecore** folder in VS Code, not a parent folder or subfolder.

**Check:** Look at the files on the left side of VS Code. Do you see:
- `App.tsx`
- `package.json`
- `components` folder

If YES ✅, you're in the right place!
If NO ❌, close VS Code and open the correct folder.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

In terminal:
```bash
npm install
```

Wait for it to finish (1-2 minutes).

### Step 4: Start the Server

In terminal:
```bash
npm run dev:mobile
```

### Step 5: Copy the Network URL

Look for a line like:
```
➜  Network: http://192.168.1.100:5173/
```

Copy that whole URL (including the `:5173` part).

### Step 6: Open on Phone

1. Make sure phone on same WiFi as computer
2. Open Safari or Chrome
3. Type the URL
4. Press Go

## 💡 Key Concepts to Understand

### Terminal = Command Line = Console

These all mean the same thing! It's where you type text commands.

### npm = Package Manager

It installs and manages code libraries. Just run the commands, don't worry about how it works internally.

### localhost vs Network URL

- **localhost** = Only your computer
- **Network URL** = Accessible on your WiFi

### Dev Server = Development Server

It's a small web server running on your computer while you develop/test.
