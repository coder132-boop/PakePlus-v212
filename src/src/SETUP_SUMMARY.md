## ⚡ What You Need to Do (2 Minutes!)

### The ONLY thing left is running ONE SQL script in Supabase:

1. **Launch the app** - It will automatically show you the setup guide
2. **Click "Open SQL Editor"** - Opens your Supabase SQL editor
3. **Click "Copy SQL Script"** - Copies the database setup script
4. **Paste and Run** - Paste into SQL editor and click Run
5. **Click "Verify Database"** - Confirms everything works

**That's it!** The app handles everything else automatically.

## 📋 What the SQL Script Creates

The script creates 3 tables with full security:

### Table 1: `user_profiles`
- Stores house membership
- User roles (admin/member)
- Display names
- Links to authentication

### Table 2: `recurring_tasks`
- Task templates created by admins
- Recurrence patterns (daily, weekdays, etc.)
- Auto-generates daily tasks
- Assignment information

### Table 3: `chores`
- Daily task instances
- Completion status (incomplete → pending_approval → completed)
- Point tracking (suggested + awarded)
- Approval workflow fields

**All tables include:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Performance indexes
- Foreign key relationships
- Timestamp tracking

## 🔐 After Database Setup

Once the database is verified, you'll:

1. **See the Auth page** - Create your account
2. **Choose your role**:
   - **Admin** → Can create tasks, approve completions, award points
   - **Member** → Can complete assigned tasks, earn points
3. **Enter house ID**:
   - First person creates a new ID
   - Others join using that ID
4. **Start using the app!**

## 🏠 How the Workflow Works

### Admin Flow:
1. Create recurring task templates (e.g., "Dishes" daily at 10 points)
2. System auto-generates today's tasks
3. Review completed tasks from members
4. Approve and award points (can adjust amount)

### Member Flow:
1. View assigned tasks for today
2. Complete tasks → mark as complete
3. Task goes to "pending approval" status
4. Admin approves → member gets points
