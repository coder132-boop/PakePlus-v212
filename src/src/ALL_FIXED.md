## How to Test Everything Works

### Test 1: Database Setup ✅
```javascript
// Paste in browser console (F12)
fetch('https://ybrwsmhxcxjqxvjyzivb.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-28dd5996/database-check', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InlicndzbWh4Y3hqcXh2anl6aXZiIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3MzM4NjgxMzIsImV4cCI6MjA0OTQ0NDEzMn0.hkWLPHKb3Zq-_kfJUiOEsgAiD4LvVGMX8_XHfJPMEho'
  }
}).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log);

// Expected: {isSetup: true, missingTables: [], ...}
```

### Test 2: No Console Warnings ✅
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Reload the page
3. Look for warnings
4. Expected: NO "Multiple GoTrueClient instances" warning

### Test 3: Login Works ✅
1. Go to "Sign In"
2. Enter credentials

   - Dashboard loads with your data

### Test 4: Session Persists ✅
1. After logging in (Test 3)
2. Close browser completely
3. Reopen browser and go to app
4. Expected: You're still logged in!

👤 User role loaded: admin

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Multiple GoTrueClient instances" Warning Still Shows

**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Close ALL tabs and reopen
4. If still appears, clear localStorage:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear();
   window.location.reload();
   ```

### Problem: "User Already Registered" Error

**This is EXPECTED and now handled properly!**
- The app will show a friendly message
- You'll be redirected to login automatically
- Just sign in with your existing credentials

**Not an error anymore - it's working as designed!**

### Problem: Not Staying Logged In

**Check these:**
1. ☑️ "Keep me logged in" was checked when you signed in
2. ☑️ You're NOT in Private/Incognito mode
3. ☑️ Browser allows localStorage (check settings)
4. ☑️ No browser extensions blocking storage

**Solution:**
1. Log out completely
2. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear();`
3. Log in again with "Keep me logged in" CHECKED
4. Test by closing and reopening browser

### Problem: Admin Features Not Showing

**Check console for:**
```
👤 User role loaded: admin
```

**If it says "member" instead:**
- Make sure you're using the account that CREATED the house
- First person to create house = admin
- Everyone who joins = member

**If no role shows:**
1. Check database has your user in `user_profiles` table
2. Check `role` column says "admin"
3. Try logging out and back in
