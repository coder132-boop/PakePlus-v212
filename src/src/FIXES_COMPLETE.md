# ‚úÖ All Fixes Complete - Admin Recognition & Dynamic Themes

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Admin Recognition Issue** ‚úÖ

**Problem:** App wasn't recognizing admins after account creation.

**Solution:** Changed the TaskContext to query the user profile directly from the Supabase database instead of relying on an API endpoint.

**Changes:**
- Added `userProfile` and `houseId` to TaskContext
- Direct database query using Supabase client
- Better error handling and console logging
- Clear user profile data on logout

**How to Verify:**
1. Create a new house OR log in with your admin account
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for: `üë§ User profile loaded: {role: 'admin', ...}`
4. Check Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Your role should say "Admin"
5. You should see the "Assign" button in navigation

const { data: profile } = await supabase
  .from('user_profiles')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)

await supabase
  .from('user_profiles')
  .update({ role: 'admin' })
  .eq('user_id', user.id);
