## What Should You Do?

### Option A: Just Use Email/Password (Easiest) ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

**Do this if:**
- You want to start using the app immediately
- You're okay with users creating email/password accounts
- You don't want to deal with Google Cloud Console setup

**What to do:**
1. Nothing! It already works.
2. Tell your users to create accounts with email/password
3. Done!

### Option B: Also Enable Google Sign-In (Optional)

**Do this if:**
- You specifically want the "Sign in with Google" button to work
- You're willing to spend 10-15 minutes setting up Google Cloud Console
- You want to give users the Google sign-in option

**What to do:**
1. Follow the instructions in `GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md`
2. It's completely optional - the app works great without it!

## Current Behavior

**When Google Sign-In is NOT set up:**
- Users see the "Sign in with Google" button
- If they click it, they get a friendly error: "Google Sign-In Not Set Up - Please use email/password instead"
- Email/password sign-in works perfectly ‚úÖ

**When Google Sign-In IS set up:**
- Both methods work! Users can choose either one
- Google users still need to create/join a house after signing in with Google

---

## Recommendation

**Skip Google OAuth for now!** You can always add it later if you want. The email/password system:
- ‚úÖ Works perfectly right now
- ‚úÖ Is easier for you (no setup needed)
- ‚úÖ Is easier for users (no confusion about which Google account to use)
- ‚úÖ Gives you full control over authentication

If you change your mind later, the instructions are in `GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md`.
