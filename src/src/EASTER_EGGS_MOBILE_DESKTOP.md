## 💡 PRO TIPS & TRICKS

### Desktop-Specific:
1. **Stack multiple effects** - Try `Ctrl+Shift+D` (disco) + type `unicorn` + `Ctrl+Shift+C`
2. **Konami code fingers** - Use arrow keys with right hand, B+A with left hand
3. **Corner clicks** - Start from top-left, go clockwise for satisfaction
4. **Mouse shake** - Wide, fast horizontal movements work best

### Mobile-Specific:
1. **Secret phrases are your friend** - These work better than keyboard shortcuts on mobile!
2. **Device shake** - Hold your device firmly and shake side-to-side rapidly
3. **Double tap speed** - Be quick! Most challenges need rapid taps within 2 seconds
4. **Corner taps** - Tap the exact corners of the screen for best results
5. **On-screen keyboard** - Works for all secret phrases (unicorn, pizza, etc.)

### Universal Tips:
1. **No cooldowns!** - Spam effects as much as you want
2. **Type "secret"** - Get random hints about other easter eggs
3. **Combo effects** - Multiple visual modes can run simultaneously
4. **Hidden aliases** - "champ" works as shortcut for "chorechamp"
5. **Case doesn't matter** - "UNICORN", "unicorn", "UnIcOrN" all work!

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Desktop Issues:

**Q: Keyboard shortcuts not working?**

- Some browsers may intercept certain shortcuts
- Try refreshing the page

**Q: Konami code not triggering?**
- Must press keys in exact order: ↑↑↓↓←→←→BA
- Use arrow keys, not WASD
- Try going slower - it's about precision, not speed!

**Q: Mouse shake not detected?**
- Move cursor horizontally in rapid, wide strokes

- Works best on larger screens

### Mobile Issues:

**Q: Secret phrases not working?**
- Make sure you're NOT in a text input field (click outside the input first)

- Shake side-to-side (not up-down)
- Some devices may have restricted motion sensors
